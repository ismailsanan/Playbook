(buffer overflow):
**The program tried to use an invalid address as a return address.**

RIP (Instruction Pointer) holds the address of the next instruction the CPU will execute.
RBP  Holds the address of the current function's stack frame start.
RSP  Points to the  LAST thing you put on the stack

stack grows from high address to low
heap grows from high address to up 


Binary reverse Engineering
- Use `GHIDRA`

Exploiting BOF
- Use `gdb` -> installed `gef`



```sh
#check the protections of the binary with the `checksec` function.
checksec

```


**NX Protection**

NX that means no shellcode execution off the stack

Exploit:
	Return Oriented Programming

```sh
1 - find the offset to the ROP
	pattern create <length> # This will determine the length of the cyclic pattern that will be generated.
	
	pattern search <pattern> # This will search the offset of the given pattern.
	

```
