SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and a service provider. While SAML is widely used to facilitate single sign-on (SSO) and other federated authentication scenarios, improper implementation or misconfiguration can expose systems to various vulnerabilities.
