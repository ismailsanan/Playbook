# Low-level logic flaw

we notice that when adding an item there is a limit of 99  but if we add 99 product then  the system flaws in letting me add 1 more

add alot till it cart arrives  2 million something after that the account goes in negative add enough items till the account balance arrives till 0 


``` HTTP
productId=1&redir=PRODUCT&quantity=1
```


# Infinite money logic flaw

the glitch is basically signup newsletter gives u percentage of discount 30 % now buy a gift card and place the  discount in it repeat the process till u have 1337 

not use intruder to insert the redeem card code , this makes your life easier 



# Authentication bypass via encryption oracle

notice that everytime we update the email when its invalid we have notification cookie  and when we write a `POST` the email gets envrypted so what awe do we enctypt `administrator:timestamp` since this format is based on the stay-login cookie in this format
notice that there is an invalid cookie decore url , base64 then delete it manually till we have the `admin:timestamp`
